## :pen: Note

if you can make any program or function shorter, but readable, please do let me know and I'll update it. 

<br>

## :book: My Exam Code Rules 

These are the rules that I generally follow when it comes to the code in the exams above:

<br>

:one: Try to make the code as short as possible
> Reason: less code generally means less logic and less to remember.

:two: Try to make the code readable
> Reason: the more the code is to human language, the easier it is to read and understand.

:three: Try to follow the 42 Norminette rules as much as possible, so none of the following: for, do, switch, case, goto, etc
> Reason: tt's what we're taught as 42 Students, so you shouldn't have to learn something new for the exams, leave that for the projects.

:four: Try not to have a function and/or main be too long and instead create break it into another function instead
> Reason: see :one: and :two: above 🔼

Remember Though Rules Are Meant To Be Broken!
